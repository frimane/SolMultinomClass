# SolMultinomClass

The SolMultinomClass package allows a reproducible research for the classification of solar radiation. It includes a set of functions to calculating extraterrestrial solar radiation incident on a given site, the day length, coding of clearness index as a vector-set of occupation numbers, and lastly a classification algorithm on those vectors of occupation numbers.
